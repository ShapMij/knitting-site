                I am Denise Shapiro—born in the luminous chaos of Monterrey, México, now unfolding my creative life beneath Florida’s ever-shifting skies. 
                I do not remember the precise moment art claimed me, only that over time, it stopped being something I did and became the very way I experience the world.
                My work is a dialogue between mediums—a conversation between the slow, deliberate grace of oil paint and the tactile intimacy of thread. 
                Oils allow me to surrender to color, to emotion, to the language of light as it bends and blooms across the canvas. With textiles, 
                I stitch memory and tension into form—each fiber a sentence, each knot a small act of defiance against the flatness of surface.
                To embroider is to scar the canvas with story. To paint is to surrender to the ineffable. I do both in search of a truth that eludes words. 
                My compositions are not merely visual—they are sensual terrains, meant to be felt with the eyes and remembered with the skin.
                Art is my ritual, my rebellion, my refuge. It is the space where I reconcile beauty and grief, silence and noise, structure and wildness.
                It is the only language that has never betrayed me.
