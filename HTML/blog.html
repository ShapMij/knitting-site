            <p> Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers 
                to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer 
                has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. 
                This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common 
                writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of 
                a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random 
                paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the 
                random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of 
                these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity 
                to incorporate the paragraph into their writing. </p>
